# JDA
Java Discord API

In this example, a simple bot is created that prints "Bot is ready!" to the console upon startup. Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` with your actual bot token.

To run this code, you will need the JDA library. You can add the Maven dependency for JDA to your `pom.xml` file:

Make sure to replace the JDA version with the latest one if it has changed since the time of writing this response.

After that, you can run your project, and the bot will be ready to use. Don't forget to add your bot to a Discord server and grant it the necessary permissions.
